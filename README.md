Lab #6: 2 arrays, 2-dim array


CST116
Module 6: Lab 6


2 arrays
Write a program that uses an array to store 10 elements, representing 10 studentsâ€™ test scores, which will be entered from the keyboard.
Iterate through the array and determine the letter grade each score will receive given the following grading scale.


A >= 92.0        B >= 84.0        C >= 75.0        D >= 65        F < 65.0


Store this grade in a second, corresponding character array.
Be sure to break this into functions so that it adheres to a good modular design.

2-dim arrays
Write a program that uses a 2-dimensional array to read in the following data:
* First name
* Last name
* Major
* Preferred pronouns


Prompt the user for each of these data.
Read in as many of these data until the user enters an empty line.
Stop as soon as the empty line is entered even if not all 4 data are entered.
After an empty line has been entered, print out all of the contents of the array formatted with descriptive headings.
Do NOT print out empty rows.
Allow for up to 100 rows to be entered.
